2. Use nvm to switch versions: `nvm use 16`
3. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
4. Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Deployment Issues
If deployment fails:
1. Check private key in `.env` file
2. Ensure sufficient APE balance for gas
3. Verify network connectivity to ApeChain testnet
4. Check gas price settings in hardhat.config.ts
